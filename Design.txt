This was a challenging project in terms of laying out the overall flow of
data through the game engine. I had to refactor the process several times,
until I came up with a system that consistently worked, and built a
few helper functions to simplify a few steps.

I think I now have a game flow that makes sense, will work consistently,
and should be approachable should someone actually want to build an app
on top of the endpoints I've laid out.

At the very least, I think I have a much better understanding of how to
set up a working API system in GAE, and could do so again if necessary.
